SHE-dull

aka - TO DO APPLICATION

this is a project i picked up when i had issues with connecting endpoints.
you might have better ways of implementing things and i dont care tbh, all i know is i understood how endpoints wwork after this project.
at thw tim of writing this readme, the code hasn't been refactored (i saccrifised my night sleep to learn this), so i pretty much didnt have strength in the end to refactor. as a result you'd be seeing my logics in the same file as ui code, so much cringr theming in the main.dart file too (forgive me).
i definitly would refactor if i get the time to come back to this project i promise.
i hope to improve this app in the future sha, like animation, documentation and stuff. but for now, goodnight. i love you! <3

ps: i can spell, im just really sleepy and need to git push so i can sleep.
